Information:
1. Start making acceptence test 

2. assert_match(/Regex Code/, ex.message)

3. irb -> pretty similar to rails console

4. Object.clone creates similar object with different ID 

5. array slicing array[start, length]
5B. array slicing [start..end(inclusive)]
5c. array slicing [start...end(exclusive)]

6. array.unshift(var) -> pushback var to array

7. Hash
hash[:hashkey]
hash.fetch(:hashkey)
Since if you use fetch, you'll know whether the hash is really nil or never assigned

8. Hash
hash = Hash.new("TEST")
hash[:one] << "TEST" # If not creating hash using blocks
Apparently, both of them append pip to all hashes
